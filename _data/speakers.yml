    bio: "Jay McClelland is the Lucie Stern Professor in the Psychology Department and Co-Director of the Center for Mind, Brain, Computation and Technology at Stanford University. He is best known for his work in laying the foundations of the connectionist approach. In recent years, his lab has begun exploring the domain of mathematical cognition, in particular, the various kinds of mathematical concepts and reasoning abilities employed by humans, including the grounding of symbols in visual diagrams, the numerical sense of humans, and others."

    bio: "Timothy Gowersis a professor at the Faculty of Mathematics in the University of Cambridge. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1998 for his valuable contributions in combinatorics and functional analysis and by finding new connections between these two areas of mathematics. He is also interested in the idea of extreme human-oriented automated theorem proving which aims to integrate the top-down approach found in human reasoning with the bottom-up process of machine calculations."
