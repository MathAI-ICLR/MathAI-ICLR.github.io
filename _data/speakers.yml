    bio: "Timothy Gowers is the holder of a chair in combinatorics at the Collège de France, and a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1998 for his valuable contributions in combinatorics and functional analysis and by finding new connections between these two areas of mathematics. He is also interested in the idea of extreme human-oriented automated theorem proving which aims to integrate the top-down approach found in human reasoning with the bottom-up process of machine calculations."

    bio: "Alison Pease is a senior lecturer in the School of Science and Engineering at the University of Dundee. Her research is concerned with investigating patterns of collaboration, reasoning and discovery, and incorporating findings into computational systems. She works mostly in mathematics, and believes that this will help us to close the gap between machine and human mathematics, both enhancing interaction between mathematicians and computers, and enabling machines to automatically generate interesting mathematics. She also apply these ideas to scientific domains, and other areas including music, poetry and health."
